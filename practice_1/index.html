    <h2 id="Biography">Biography</h2><br>
    <p> The Timewriter aka Jean Frank Cochois, is a German house record producer. His trademark style<br>
        can be characterised by its dense and atmospheric sound. UK Muzik magazine wrote:<br>
        "This is real 21st century soul music, overflowing with magic". Under various<br>
        pseudonyms he has been releasing 12" and artist albums on labels as Plastic City,<br>
        Mole Listening Pearls, Elektrolux and American labels such as Wave Music, Driftwood,<br>
        and Fiji. He amalgamates the deep soul of Motown with synthetic sound productions.<br>
        Jean was born into a family where music played a vital part in everyday life. <br>
        From the age of 13 on, he got trained in classical music and was sent to a music boarding school.<br>
        Soon he started experimenting with electronic music while also including acoustic instruments.<br>
        It was Tom Wax who introduced Frank Cochois to the upcoming label Plastic City in 1995.<br>
        Next to Terry Lee Brown Jr., The Timewriter would become THE most influential artist in<br>
        the development of Plastic City as one of the major outlets for TechHouse in Germany and beyond.

    <p> From sleeve: "MUZIK UK said it best: "This is real 21st century soul music, devoid of clich√©,<br>
        overflowing with magic... glorious, irresistible, deep funky dance music." The Timewriter is<br>
        none other than Jean F. Cochois, and this is his second album. His debut, "Letters From The Jester",<br>
        won rave reviews from the World's leading dance music magazines. 6/7 from Germany's Raveline,<br>
        9/10 from UK's Muzik, 9/10 from Mixmag US, and a perfect score from Seattle's XLR8R, who named it<br>
        one of their Top 5 for 1997. Just that year, The Timewriter released his first mix album on<br>
        the Twisted label entitled "Greetings from Plastic City". But it is with "Jigsaw Pieces" that<br>
        we can see the whole picture. Sit back and enjoy. Deep atmospheric house has never sounded so Twisted."<br>
        Album programmed and produced nine-eight at "Silent Chamber".

    <p> After two sell out parties at the Paramount... Wiggle have been lucky enough to get the chance to take<br>
        over this jaw dropping space for New Years eve and what better place to see in the new year.<br>
        Having London town as our own personal fireworks display from 384 feet up, while busting some moves,<br>
        has to be a must see and do experience. Wiggle had a NYE party and it's about time we did it properly,<br>
        so expect fireworks.... literally!<br>
